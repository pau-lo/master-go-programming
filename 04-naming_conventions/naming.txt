Naming conventions
+----------------------------

Naming conventions are important for code readability and maintainability

- Name starts with a letter or an underscore
- cases matter
- Go keywords cannot be used as names
- use the first letters of the words
    i.e.

    var mv int // mv -> max value

- use fewer letter in smaller scopes and the complete word in larger scopes

var packetsReceived int // Is not ok, too verbose

var n int // is ok.  number of packets Received

var taskDone bool // Is ok in letter scopes
