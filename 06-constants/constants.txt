Constant values

- Constant represents fixed values
- used to avoid possible errors
- all basic literals --> all unamed constants
- A constant belongs to the compile time and it's created at compile time.  Thus, value
  can't be change while the program is running
- You can declare constants that store numbers, strings or booleans.
