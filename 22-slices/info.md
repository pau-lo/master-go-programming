# Slices in Go

- Has a dynamci length (it can shrink or grow)
- The length of a slice is not part of its type and it belogns to runtime
- An uninitialized slice is equal to nil (its zero value is nil)

- Both slice and array can contain only the same type of elements
- We can create a keyed slice like a keyed array
